Infinite Craft solver

The `recipe-map.bincode` file is generated by `cargo -p combine-recipes` combining:

- [In-Finite-Craft](https://github.com/StarGazingHomies/In-Finite-Craft/) [depth-9 relevant_recipes.json](https://github.com/StarGazingHomies/In-Finite-Craft/releases/tag/Recipes9).
- [InfiniteCraftHelper](https://github.com/Mikarific/InfiniteCraftHelper/) `recipes.db`, posted on the Infinite Craft Discord, recovered DB corruption using `sqlite .recover`.
- Additional recipes by me.

Thank you @StarGazingHomies and @Mikarific for the recipe database files.
